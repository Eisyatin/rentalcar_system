## Improvements Made

### Before and After Enhancements

   - **After:** Customers can now book a car using a booking form provided on the website.

2. **Booking Management:**
   - **Before:** The clerk had to collect bookings and customers' personal information through WhatsApp.
   - **After:** The clerk can view and manage all bookings, with customers' private information stored in a database.

3. **Website Interface:**
   - **Before:** The website interface was confusing, did not show customers car model images with details directly, and there was no clear starting point for booking.
   - **After:** The website now shows customers various car models with specifications. Customers can click on a car image to display the booking form.
